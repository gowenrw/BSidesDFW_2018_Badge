# datasheets

This directory is for data sheets for components used

The PCB requires the following components to make it a functional LAN TAP:
4x RJ45 Connectors: Amphenol RJHSE-5080 (unshielded) or RJHSE-5380 (shielded)
2x 220pF through-hole capacitors with .1" lead spacing (e.g. Xicon 140-50P2-221K-RC)

The datasheets for both components are in this directory.
