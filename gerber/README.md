# gerber

This directory is for final production files

The zip file BSidesDFW_2018_Badge-gerber.zip contains all the gerber files that were sent to manufacturing for the prototype boards.

When we regenerate the gerber files for the production run all the individual files will be overwritten and a new zip file created.
